                <h1>What is Serverless Computing?</h1>
                <p>Serverless computing is a type of cloud computing service that enables developers to focus on the front-end development and not have to worry about the back-end or infrastrucutre required. All developers will need to do is write their code for the application and deploy it to containers managed by cloud providers. The cloud provider handles the infrastructure required to run the code as well as scaling it up and down depending on demand. The provider is also responsible for all the routine maintenance such as updating operating systems, security management, capacity planning and system monitoring. An important note is with serverless computing a customer never pays for idle capacity as the cloud provider spins up and required resources for the application on demand and then spins down back again when execution of the code stops, this is know as 'scaling to zero'.</p>

                <h1>The Benefits of Serverless Computing</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>A customer only pays for the execution of the code reducing the amount of money spent</li>
                    <li>No large up front cost for infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Serverless computing is a polyglot environment meaning developers can use any programming language</li>
                    <li>Developers do not need to focus on the back-end architecture</li>
                    <li>Quicker development times</li>

                <h1>The Disadvantages of Serverless Computing</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are trusting a cloud provider to keep your data secure</li>
                    <li>Your resources are shared in a cloud environment which could impact performance</li>
                    <li>Some providers can lock you into a long term agreement preventing you from changing providers</li>
                    <li>You do not have full control over the environment and the provider could change something that impacts the customer</li>
                    <li>Serverless computers scale down to zero requiring a cold start to initiate resources causing a wait period</li>

                <h1>Uses of Serverless Computing</h1>
                <p>Serverless Computing offers a range of use cases that can be benefitical, here are some of them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any activity that required triggers as an event such as sending a welcome email when a user signs up to a website which is triggered by a change in the database</li>
                    <li>Building RESTful APIs</li>
                    <li>Asynchronus processing</li>
                    <li>IoT applications</li>
