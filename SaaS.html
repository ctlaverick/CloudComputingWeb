                <h1>What is Software as a Service?</h1>
                <p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a cloud computing service which provides customers access to software via the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. Customers pay, normally a montly or annually fee, to use the software through the internet which is typically a web browser on a computer but can also be used on phones, tablets and any other device capable of using an internet browser. Common examples of the types of software provided via SaaS are email such as GMail or Outlook, calendaring and office tools such as Microsoft office 365. SaaS is in fact the most common type of cloud computing and has become mainstream in buisnesses. SaaS is great for buisnesses due to their little to no management and no maintenance required from the customer. The provider is responsible for the hardware and software, the maintenance, fixing bugs, providing new features, security, redudency in the infrastrucutre and backups of customers data. Many SaaS providers also have an application programming interface (API) that customers cna use to combine multiple SaaS interfaces or even traditional software</p>
