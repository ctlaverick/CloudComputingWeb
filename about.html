                <h1>What is cloud computing?</h1>
                <p>Simply put cloud computing is the abillity to access and utilise computer hardware and software through the internet. The cloud refers to the phsyical servers (computers) that are accessed during cloud computer services. There are many services cloud computing offers the most common being cloud storage where you can store data on a cloud and access it from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
                <!-- <p>Cloud computing is the on demmand access to computer hardware or software through the internet. This allows customers to access their services from anywhere with a connection to the internet. Cloud computing is most commonly used for data storage but can also be used for networking, databases, software, analytics and intelligence</p> -->
