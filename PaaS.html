                <h1>What is Platform as a Service?</h1>
                <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service where access to a complete development and deployment environment is provided via the internet. This service is used to provide developers the perfect environment to develop new apps or experiement whilst not worrying about the infrastrucutre to run their application. Due to the service being scalable customers pay only for what they need reducing costs of development</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pros">
                <h1>The Benefits of PaaS</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pay-as-you-go model makes it possible for customers to use sophisticated development software and business intelligence and analytic tools that they would not typically be able to afford to purchase</li>
                    <li>Reduction in upfront development costs due to customers not having to pay large amounts for infrastrucutre</li>
                    <li>Development for cross-platform applications becomes easier</li>
                    <li>Accessing the environment via the internet allows for global access and therefore global teams</li>
                    <li>Pre-coded application components built into the platform cut down the coding time</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="cons">
                <h1>The Disadvantages of IaaS</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requires the internet to use</li>
                    <li>There is no way for the customer to manage their own security</li>
                    <li>PaaS options are less scalable than other cloud computing services</li>
                    <li>If a PaaS service is not compatable with a customers current infrastrucutre they may be required to pay for new infrastrucutre or be foreced to not use the PaaS service </li>

                <h1>Uses of IaaS</h1>
                <p>PaaS offers a range of use cases that can be benefitical for developers, here are some of them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developent framework for cloud based applications</li>
                    <li>Analytics or business intelligence tools allow customers to collect and analyse their data to find insights and patterns to improve efficiency</li>
                    <li>PaaS supports IoT development</li>
                    <li>PaaS can provide configured environments for automating the software application lifecycle including delivery, testing and deployment</li>
                    <li>PaaS can be used in hybrid clouds</li>
